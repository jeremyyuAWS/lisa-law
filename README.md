# üì± Lisa Law ‚Äì AI Legal Intake Assistant (Demo App)

This is a demo application showcasing how an AI agent can assist users in identifying their legal needs using **voice or chat**, classifying them by **area of law** and **U.S. state**, and routing them to appropriate nonprofit legal aid‚Äîespecially focused on **Immigration Law** for low-income users.

Built with [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), styled using [BuouUI](https://buouui.com/), and powered by **Lyzr AI** and **ElevenLabs**.

---

## üéØ Objective

Build a mobile-first demo that:

- Accepts **voice or chat input**
- Identifies the **type of legal issue**
- Detects the **user‚Äôs state or location**
- Recommends the next steps or **legal aid referrals**
- Emphasizes support for **immigration law** cases

## üß† AI Agent Capabilities

### Prompt Behavior
The agent performs three key actions:
1. **Classifies legal topic**
2. **Extracts U.S. state from context**
3. **Determines task-based vs. lawyer-referral need**

### Example:
> **User says**: "I need help applying for asylum. I'm currently in Arizona."

> **Agent responds**:  
> "It sounds like you're seeking immigration support in Arizona. I found 2 legal aid nonprofits that might be able to help. Would you like their contact info?"
